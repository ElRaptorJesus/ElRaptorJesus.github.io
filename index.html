Hi there, you probably found this site by some leaks on some website that this where you can get a free minecraft account. im leaking them and i work at mojang, they are very greedy and i dont consider them indie anymore so now a couple notes on how to get your free mc account.
1:you MUST be on windows, i only got this to work on windows computers.
2:download the file, after you ran it restart your computer and then go to the official minecraft website and download the minecraft client.
3:when you install minecraft your going to notice it doesnt ask you for a account name/password, this is the exploit in work. you wont have to run the freemc file after this.
4:enjoy!

im sorry this website isnt fancy, i didnt have alot of time to whip things together.

you might notice if you got this link off some forum or site that the name of the website is weird and might not have to do much with minecraft, this is because the person who posted this had to choose a link name, this way the site is safe and cant be found by mojang

this sites name is: ElRaptorJesus.github.io <br>
