Welcome, this is a temporary website that we'll use to leak accounts for certain games/websites or make account generators for them, we don't have much accomplished at the moment but we update it monthly.<br>

We're planning on getting free account generators for these websites/games: (May take a while to make them, so please be patient)<br>

(We only let trusted individuals edit this website so they're all gonna write personally how to get certain accounts or download account generators, sorry if it may seem strange or disorganized.)<br>

MIND KRAFT ACCOUNT MAKERER:(hector again)<br>
Hi there, you probably found this website by some leaks on some website that this where you can get a free Minecraft account.<br>

I'm leaking them and I work at Mojang, they are very greedy and I dont consider them indie anymore so now a several steps on how to get your free Minecraft account.<br>

Step 1: You MUST be on Windows, I only got this to work on windows computers.<br>

Step 2: Download the file, after you run it, restart your computer and then go to the official Minecraft website and download the Minecraft client.<br>

Step 3: When you install Minecraft you're going to notice it doesn't ask you for an account name/password, this is the exploit in work, you wont have to run the freemc file after this.<br>

Step 4: Enjoy!<br>

I'm sorry this website is not fancy, I didn't have a lot of time to whip things together.<br>

You might notice if you got this link off some forum or website that the name of the website is weird and might not have to do much with Minecraft, this is because the person who posted this had to choose a link name, this way the site is safe and can't be detected by Mojang easily<br>

This website's name is: ElRaptorJesus.github.io <br>
